High power RGB LED work

  Solid discussion of real power requirements, 1440 RGB's:

  Modest 144 RGB's in a Sousaphone (somewhat or fully portable):

  * Yes, they really do draw 60 mA at full brightness

  * Reference project (1440 RGB's) took a 60 Ampere 5 Volt Meanwell RSP-320-5 (USD $67, Mouser, October 2022)

  * Ref project used all three outputs of that power supply, sharing load 1/3 total per main output bus

  * Ref project chose 12 AWG wiring '12 gauge wire'

  * Ref project uses 1440 RGB's, 60 mA (max) per RGB
```
    1440 x 0.06 Ampere = 86.40 Amperes

      $ dc -e '5 k 1440 0.06 * p q'  86.40

    5 Volts x 86.40 Amperes = 432 Watts  @5VDC

      $ dc -e '5 k 5 86.4 * p q'   432.0
```

  * Ref project power supply capable of 300 Watts output @5VDC
```
      $ dc -e '5 k 5 60 * p q'   300
```
  * Ref project author refers to this as '70%' capable (the PSU can
    deliver 70% of the required current @5VDC)

END.
