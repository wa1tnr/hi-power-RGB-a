High power RGB LED work

  Solid discussion of real power requirements, 1440 RGB's.

  * 1,500 NeoPixel LED Curtain with Raspberry Pi and Fadecandy
    By Phillip Burgess

  * RGB Sousaphone Project - Controller interface
    By Jon Swope

  * NeoPixels do draw 60 mA at full brightness - it's true!

  * 60 Ampere 5 Volt power supply is not entirely beyond reason

  * But it takes careful planning and some corners simply must not be cut. ;)

  * 60A 5V power supply capable of 300 Watts output (@5VDC) and much less at mains voltage (input).

  * Think 12 AWG or 10 AWG wiring for the DC output side.

  * Magnitude of coverage is 1440 RGB's (24 strips of 60 RGB's per strip, fed in groups of eight strips from three parallel bus wiring points) in the reference project

  * Sourcing of large power supplies (what to look for)

  * Low-power portable projects (for comparison)

  * Random (heh) related factoids

  * Use of the **dc calculator** program, throughout.  Nothing to do with DC current; name similarity is coincidental

END.
